	debugger;

That’s very convenient when we are in a code editor and don’t want to switch to the browser and look up the script in developer tools to set the breakpoint.

## Summary

As we can see, there are three main ways to pause a script:

A breakpoint.
The debugger statements.
An error (if dev tools are open and the button  is “on”)
Then we can examine variables and step on to see where the execution goes wrong.

There are many more options in developer tools than covered here. The full manual is at https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools.

_`Oh, and also you can click at various places of dev tools and just see what’s showing up. That’s probably the fastest route to learn dev tools. Don’t forget about the right click as well!`_


Techniques:

1. Conditional Breakpoint[http://disq.us/p/1q3qqe1]

> Right click on the line number allows to create a conditional breakpoint. It only triggers when the given expression is truthy.
> That’s handy when we need to stop only for a certain variable value or for certain function parameters.

It's also handy when you want to log stuff without actually modifying the code directly. For example, by making the breakpoint's conditional expression be something like "console.log(someLocalVariable)". `console functions always return a falsy value`, so the breakpoint will never trigger, but the log statement will still print to the console.

It's very convenient when you're in the browser and don’t want to switch to a code editor to edit the script to add a log statement. :)

2. Minfied vs Unminified Code[http://disq.us/p/1q3qqe1]

If you see a code like that, it's called a minified version or production version. It removes unnecessary spaces and carriage returns and makes the whole code into a single line.
`Pretty print` makes it unminified and readable. :)

3. console.log alias[http://disq.us/p/1v738yl]

const log = console.log.bind(console);

use like this:

log('hello world');

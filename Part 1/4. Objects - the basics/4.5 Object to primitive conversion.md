# [Object to primitive conversion](https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive)

What happens when objects are added obj1 + obj2, subtracted obj1 - obj2 or printed using alert(obj)?

There are special methods in objects that do the conversion.

In the chapter [Type Conversions](https://javascript.info/type-conversions) we’ve seen the rules for numeric, string and boolean conversions of primitives. But we left a gap for objects. Now, as we know about methods and symbols it becomes possible to close it.

For objects, `there’s no to-boolean conversion`, because all objects are true in a boolean context. So there are only string and numeric conversions.

The numeric conversion happens when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For instance, Date objects (to be covered in the chapter [Date and time](https://javascript.info/date)) can be subtracted, and the result of date1 - date2 is the time difference between two dates.

As for the string conversion – it usually happens when we output an object like alert(obj) and in similar contexts.

# [ToPrimitive](https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive#toprimitive)

When an object is used in the context where a primitive is required, for instance, in an alert or mathematical operations, it’s converted to a primitive value using the ToPrimitive algorithm ([specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive)).

That algorithm allows us to customize the conversion using a special object method.

Depending on the context, the conversion has a so-called “hint”.

There are three variants:

"string"

When an operation expects a string, for object-to-string conversions, like alert:

	// output
	alert(obj);
	// using object as a property key
	anotherObj[obj] = 123;

# [ToPrimitive](https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive#toprimitive)

When an object is used in the context where a primitive is required, for instance, in an alert or mathematical operations, it’s converted to a primitive value using the ToPrimitive algorithm ([specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive)).

That algorithm allows us to customize the conversion using a special object method.

Depending on the context, the conversion has a so-called “hint”.

There are three variants:

"string"

When an operation expects a string, for object-to-string conversions, like alert:

	// output
	alert(obj);

	// using object as a property key
	anotherObj[obj] = 123;

"number"

When an operation expects a number, for object-to-number conversions, like maths:

	// explicit conversion
	let num = Number(obj);

	// maths (except binary plus)
	let n = +obj; // unary plus
	let delta = date1 - date2;

	// less/greater comparison
	let greater = user1 > user2;

"default"

Occurs in rare cases when the operator is “not sure” what type to expect.

For instance, binary plus + can work both with strings (concatenates them) and numbers (adds them), so both strings and numbers would do. Or when an object is compared using == with a string, number or a symbol.

	// binary plus
	let total = car1 + car2;

	// obj == string/number/symbol
	if (user == 1) { ... };

The greater/less operator <> can work with both strings and numbers too. Still, it uses “number” hint, not “default”. That’s for historical reasons.

In practice, all built-in objects except for one case (Date object, we’ll learn it later) implement "default" conversion the same way as "number". And probably we should do the same.

Please note – there are only three hints. It’s that simple. There is no “boolean” hint (all objects are true in boolean context) or anything else. And if we treat "default" and "number" the same, like most built-ins do, then there are only two conversions.

To do the conversion, JavaScript tries to find and call three object methods:

1. Call obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) if the method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is "string"
	try obj.toString() and obj.valueOf(), whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is "number" or "default"
	try obj.valueOf() and obj.toString(), whatever exists.


# [Symbol.toPrimitive](https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive#symbol-toprimitive)

# [toString/valueOf](https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive#tostring-valueof)

# [ToPrimitive and ToString/ToNumber](https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive#toprimitive-and-tostring-tonumber)

## Historical notes
For historical reasons, methods toString or valueOf should return a primitive: if any of them returns an object, then there’s no error, but that object is ignored (like if the method didn’t exist).

In contrast, Symbol.toPrimitive must return a primitive, otherwise, there will be an error.

# Summary

The object-to-primitive conversion is called automatically by many built-in functions and operators that expect a primitive as a value.

There are 3 types (hints) of it:

"string" (for alert and other string conversions)
"number" (for maths)
"default" (few operators)
The specification describes explicitly which operator uses which hint. There are very few operators that “don’t know what to expect” and use the "default" hint. Usually for built-in objects "default" hint is handled the same way as "number", so in practice the last two are often merged together.

The conversion algorithm is:

1. Call obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) if the method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is "string"
	try obj.toString() and obj.valueOf(), whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is "number" or "default"
	try obj.valueOf() and obj.toString(), whatever exists.
	
In practice, it’s often enough to implement only obj.toString() as a “catch-all” method for all conversions that return a “human-readable” representation of an object, for logging or debugging purposes.

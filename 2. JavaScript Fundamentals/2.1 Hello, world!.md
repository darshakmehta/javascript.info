### [The “script” tag](https://javascript.info/hello-world#the-script-tag)

The script tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser meets the tag.

### [The modern markup](https://javascript.info/hello-world#the-modern-markup)

### The type attribute: script type=…

The old standard HTML4 required a script to have a type. Usually it was type="text/javascript". It’s not required anymore.

### The language attribute: script language=…

This attribute was meant to show the language of the script. This attribute no longer makes sense, because JavaScript is the default language. No need to use it.

Comments before and after scripts.


### [External Scripts](https://javascript.info/hello-world#external-scripts)

script src="/path/to/script.js"

Here /path/to/script.js is an absolute path to the file with the script (from the site root).

To attach several scripts, use multiple script tags

** As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.

The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and then store it in its cache.

After this, other pages that want the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it. So the file is actually downloaded only once.

That saves traffic and makes pages faster.**

# [Developer Console](https://javascript.info/devtools)

Most often developers lean towards Chrome or Firefox for development because those browsers have the best developer tools. Other browsers also provide developer tools, sometimes with special features, but are usually playing “catch-up” to Chrome or Firefox. So most people have a “favorite” browser and switch to others if a problem is browser-specific.

1. Developer tools allow us to see errors, run commands, examine variables and much more.
2. They can be opened with F12 for most browsers under Windows. Chrome for Mac needs Cmd+Opt+J, Safari: Cmd+Opt+C (need to enable first).
